You can totally do this
Don't tell people your plans. Show them your results.
No pressure, no diamonds.
We can do anything we want to if we stick to it long enough.
Stay foolish to stay sane.
When nothing goes right, go left.
Try Again. Fail again. Fail better.
Impossible is for the unwilling.
Do not compare yourself to others. If you do so, you are hurting yourself.
When you have a dream, you've got to grab it and never let go.
Nothing is impossible. The word itself says I'm possible!
Believe you can and youâ€™re halfway there.
Life is a box of chocolates, but it's mostly because you're here.
